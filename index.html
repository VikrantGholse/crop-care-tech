                            <p>The Disease Detection service utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as image recognition and machine learning to detect diseases in crops at an early stage. By analyzing images of crops captured using drones or smartphones, the system can identify symptoms of diseases, pests, or abnormalities. Early detection enables farmers to take timely action, such as applying targeted treatments or implementing preventive measures, to prevent the spread of diseases and minimize crop losses.</p>
